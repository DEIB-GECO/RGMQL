\title{GMQL Operation: FLAT}
\usage{
flat(input_data, minAcc, maxAcc, groupBy = NULL, aggregates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{returned object from any GMQL function}

\item{minAcc}{minimum number of overlapping regions to be considered during execution.
Normally it must be > 0, we admit value 0 and -1 as special value:
\itemize{
\item {-1: means ALL and sets the minimum to the number of samples in the input dataset}
}}

\item{maxAcc}{maximum number of overlapping regions to be considered during execution
\itemize{
\item {0: means ANY and acts as a wildcard and can be used only as maxAcc value}
\item {-1: means ALL and sets the maximum to the number of samples in the input dataset}
}}

\item{groupBy}{a vector of strings specifying grouping criteria}

\item{aggregates}{a list of element in the form key = 'function_aggregate'.
'function_aggregate' is an object of class OPERATOR
The aggregate functions available are: MIN, MAX, SUM, BAG, AVG, COUNT.
Every operator accepts a string value, execet for COUNT that cannot have a value.
Argument of 'function_aggregate' must exist in schema.
Two styles are allowed:}

\value{
"url-like" string
}
\description{
returns the contiguous region that starts from the first end and stops at
the last end of the regions which would contribute to each region of the COVER
