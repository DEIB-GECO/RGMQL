\title{CONDITION object class}
\usage{
EXACT(value)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{single string identifying name of metadata attribute you
want to put in evaluation}
}
\value{
EXACT condition object
}
\description{
This class is used to create instances of condition object
to be used in GMQL functions that require evaluation condition on value
}
\details{
CONDITION object available are:
\itemize{
\item{FULL: Fullname evaluation, two attributes match if they both end with value and,
if they have a further prefixes, the two prefix sequence are identical}
\item{DEF: Default evaluation, two attributes match if both end with value. }
\item{EXACT: Exact evaluation, only attributes exactly as value will match; no further prefixes are allowed. }
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

#### select with DEF condition
#### the full condition is treated as DEF due to coercion
s = select(input_data = r, semi_join = c("cell_type","cell",EXACT("attribute_tag")),
semi_join_dataset = c)

#### select with condition
#### the first is FULL and the other ones are DEF
s = select(input_data = r, semi_join = c(EXACT("attribute_tag"),"cell_type","cell"),
semi_join_dataset = c)

#### select with condition
s = select(input_data = r, semi_join = list("cell_type",EXACT("cell")), semi_join_dataset = c)
