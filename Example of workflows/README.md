This folder contains three fully reproducible examples of use cases using expressive power and flexibility of the RGMQL package in biologically relevant applications.
Open the RProject file [EXAMPLES.Rproj](EXAMPLES.Rproj) to set automatically the working directory for the use cases.
For all the use cases, complete workflows are available as R Notebooks:[use_case_1.Rmd](use_case_1.Rmd), [use_case_2.Rmd](use_case_2.Rmd)], [use_case_3.Rmd](use_case_3.Rmd).
Also, corresponding HTML files are available to show the results we previously obtained: [use_case_1.html](use_case_1.html, [use_case_2.html](use_case_2.html)], [use_case_3.html](use_case_3.html).

N.B. Before running use case 2, please refer to [To_run_use_case_2.txt](To_run_use_case_2.txt) and choose one of the options to obtain locally the needed second dataset, e.g. provided within [GRCh38_miRNA_ACC.zip](GRCh38_miRNA_ACC.zip) file. 

We suggest to try also the examples in [vignettes/RGMQL-vignette.Rmd](./../vignettes/RGMQL-vignette.Rmd) to become more familiar with the RGMQL functions, before replicating these workflows.
