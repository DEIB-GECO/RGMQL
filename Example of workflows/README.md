This forlder contains three fully reproducible examples of use cases using expressive power and flexibility of the RGMQL package in biologically relevant applications.
For each use case, the complete workflow is available as a R Notebook: also, a corresponding HTML file is available to show the results we previously obtained.

We suggest to try also the examples of the vignette [vignettes/RGMQL-vignette.Rmd](vignettes/RGMQL-vignette.Rmd) of the RGMQL package to become more familiar with the RGMQL functions, before replicating these workflows.
