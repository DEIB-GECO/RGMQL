To run use case 2:

-Please, extract GRCh38_miRNA_ACC.zip file into the 'Example of workflows' folder before use.

-Alternatively, download the same miRNA dataset from GMQL web-interface (http://www.gmql.eu/gmql-rest/), using the following query:

  DATA_SET_2 = SELECT(biospecimen__admin__disease_code == "ACC") GRCh38_TCGA_miRNA_expression_2019_10;
  MATERIALIZE DATA_SET_2 INTO GRCh38_miRNA_ACC;
 
 and move it in the 'Example of workflows' folder before use.

-Otherwise, use the following RGMQL code to create the same GMQLDataset from the GMQL remote repository: 

  GRCh38_miRNA <- read_gmql(dataset = "public.GRCh38_TCGA_miRNA_expression_2019_10", is_local = FALSE)
  GRCh38_miRNA_ACC <- filter(GRCh38_miRNA, gdc__project__project_id == "TCGA-ACC")
