\title{GMQL Operation: SELECT}
\usage{
select(input_data, predicate = NULL, region_predicate = NULL,
    semi_join = NULL, semi_join_negation = FALSE, semi_join_dataset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{returned object from any GMQL function}

\item{predicate}{logical predicate made up by R logical operation 
on metadata attribute. 
Only !, |, ||, &, && are admitted.}

\item{region_predicate}{logical predicate made up by R logical operation 
on chema region values. 
Only !, |, ||, &, && are admitted.}

\item{semi_join}{list of CONDITION objects where every object contains 
the name of metadata to be used in semijoin, or simple string concatenation 
of name of metadata, e.g. c("cell_type", "attribute_tag", "size") 
without declaring condition.
The CONDITION's available are:
\itemize{
\item{\code{\link{FULL}}: Fullname evaluation, two attributes match 
if they both end with value and, if they have a further prefixes,
the two prefix sequence are identical}
\item{\code{\link{EXACT}}: Exact evaluation, only attributes exactly 
as value will match; no further prefixes are allowed. }
}
Every condition accepts only one string value. (e.g. FULL("cell_type") )
In case of single concatenation with no CONDITION or list with some value 
without conditon, the metadata are considered having default 
evaluation: the two attributes match if both end with value.}

\item{semi_join_negation}{logical value: T => semijoin is perfomed 
considering semi_join NOT IN semi_join_dataset, F => semijoin is performed 
considering semi_join IN semi_join_dataset}

\item{semi_join_dataset}{returned object from any GMQL function}
}
\value{
DataSet class object. It contains the value to use as input 
for the subsequent GMQL function
}
\description{
It extracts a subset of samples from the input dataset.
It returns all the samples satisfying the predicate on metadata.
If regions are specified, returns regions satisfying the predicate 
on regions.
If semijoin clauses are specified they are applied, too.
When semijoin is defined, it extracts those samples containing all metadata 
attribute defined in semijoin clause with at least one metadata value 
in common with semi join dataset.
If no metadata in common beetween input dataset and semi join dataset, 
no sample is extracted.
}
\examples{

## It selects from input data samples of patients younger than 70 years old, 
## based on filtering on sample metadata attribute Patient_age

init_gmql()
test_path <- system.file("example", "DATASET", package = "RGMQL")
input <- read_dataset(test_path)
s <- select(input, Patient_age < 70)


\dontrun{

It creates a new dataset called 'jun_tf' by selecting those samples and 
their regions from the existing 'data' dataset such that:
Each output sample has a metadata attribute called antibody_target 
with value JUN.
Each output sample also has not a metadata attribute called cell 
that has the same value of at least one of the values that a metadata 
attribute equally called cell has in at least one sample 
of the 'join_data' dataset.
For each sample satisfying previous condition,only its regions that 
have a region attribute called pValue with the associated value 
less than 0.01 are conserved in output


init_gmql()
test_path <- system.file("example", "DATASET", package = "RGMQL")
test_path2 <- system.file("example", "DATASET_GDM", package = "RGMQL")
data <- read_dataset(test_path)
join_data <-  read_dataset(test_path2)
jun_tf <- select(data, antibody_target == 'JUN', pValue < 0.01, c("cell"), 
TRUE, semi_join_dataset = join_data )

}
