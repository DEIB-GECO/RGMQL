Title: GenoMetric Query Language for R/Bioconductor
Version: 0.99.5
Author: Simone Pallotta, Marco Masseroli

Description: This package brings GMQL functionalities into R environemnt.
    GMQL stands for Genometric Query Language for extracting regions of interest from 
    experiments and for computing their properties, 
    with high-level operations for manipulating regions and for measuring their distances
    This package offers flexible, robust, high performance functions to perform GMQL queries.
    It provides two different approaches in writing GMQL queries:
        a) REST based GMQL calls
        b) standard R APIs
    The REST approach allows user to manage remote big genomic dataset hosted in complex cluster based infrastructure.
    Multiple REST invocation can run concurrently on remote infrastructure allowing user to test progress of every call.
    The R APIs allow user to works with local data using batch-like approach where single invocation must be invoked sequentially
    The REST approach allows to perform text-based GMQL queries while standard APIs implement distinct function for every GMQL operation.
    The package provides a rich set of ancillary classes used by R APIs that allows sophisticated input/output management and sorting.
