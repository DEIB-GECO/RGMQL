General
-------
- In metajoin condition (for all operators that include such condition), EXACT(metadata_attribute_name) and FULLNAME(metadata_attribute_name) can be used



PROJECT
-------
- To express which set of region attributes should be considered the wildcard "?" can be used (at most one per attribute); the syntax is:. PROJECT(S.?, ?.att, S.?.att) no PROJECT(?.S.?)

- default PROJECT() :
	-it applies the project only on the regions and removes all the region fields; only the coordinates (chr, start, stop, strand) are kept.



MAP
---
- count is always performed and saved in the attribute named count_S1_S2 by default; to rename it to myCountName use the following syntax:
Z = MAP(count_name: myCountName) X Y;



JOIN
----
- default JOIN(): DISTANCE < 0.



DIFFERENCE
----------
- DIFFERENCE operates in two different modes based on region intersection (default), or exact matching; to use the latter one specify the parameter "exact: true"



ORDER
-----
- default ORDER():
  - order do not have a default form (the above statement does not compile). At least one parameter is required.



COVER/FLAT/SUMMIT/HISTOGRAM
---------------------------
- default COVER/FLAT/SUMMIT/HISTOGRAM():
  - NOW should not have a default ... [BEFORE: the default behaviour was as COVER/FLAT/SUMMIT/HISTOGRAM(1,ANY)]
